Build a simple restaurant discovery app.

Required Features:
- The app will use the Google Places API for its data source
- The app will prompt the user for permission to access their current location
- Upon launch the app will execute a search that displays nearby restaurants
- A search feature will be included that allows the user to search for restaurants
- The user may choose to display the search results as a list, or as pins on a map
- The user may select a search result to display basic information about the restaurant

Project Requirements:
- You may use the API key AIzaSyC9iT33vKT-pb7Lrok97X5aNPhGlY6iDBo.  This is not an unlimited key and may only be used for this assignment.
- The developer may use whatever language they choose
- The developer may make use of third party libraries if they choose, however they should NOT use Google's Places API client
- The code should be written with a production level of quality, as if it were going to be distributed as-is

Bonus Points:
- Allow the user to flag restaurants as a favorite, and indicate its favorite status in the current and future search results

Your completed code should be shared with AllTrails via GitHub.  Please be prepared to participate in a code review with one of the AllTrails engineers as part of your technical screening.
